### What is this project for? ###

"The Device" emulates a bomb with a countdown timer and a set of wires which must be cut to "defuse" it. 
It is composed of a state machine which communicated with two Arduino Nano devices, one of these is 
handing the display of 4 RGB LEDs which are used to indicate a sequence which should be selected 
in order to select a coloured wire to cut and another which keeps a consistent countdown 
for an initial starting figure of what appears to be minutes and seconds.

Originally developed for CDX 2017.
  
* This is version 2.0 of the device for CDX 2018
