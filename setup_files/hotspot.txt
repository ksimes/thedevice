1) Run the following commands to install dnsmasq and hostapd and get them ready for configuration:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install dnsmasq hostapd
	sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
	sudo systemctl stop hostapd

2) Edit the following files to use the settings you want to use:
	dnsmasq.conf - change your device's IP here
	hostapd.conf - set your device's WiFi SSID and password here
	
3) Copy the following files to your raspberry pi:
	dhcpd.conf
	dnsmasq.conf
	hostapd.conf

	(e.g.) scp dhcpcd.conf pi@192.168.1.110:dhcpcd.conf

4) Configure dhcpd:
	mv /etc/dhcpcd.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf.orig
	mv ~/dhcpcd.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf

5) Configure hostapd:
	mv ~/hostapd.conf /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
	sudo vi /etc/default/hostapd
	- Then set DAEMON_CONF to:
		DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"

6) Configure dnsmasq:
	sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig  
	mv ~/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf

7) Set up IPV4 forwarding
	sudo vi /et/sysctl.conf
	- Remove the # from the line that says: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
	- This will apply from a reboot, or you can activate it immediately with:
		sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

8) Optional: forward the Pi's connection to connected devices:
	sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  
	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  
	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

	sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
	sudo vi /etc/rc.local
	- Just above "exit 0" add:
		iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat

Either reboot the device, or run the following commands:
	sudo service hostapd start  
	sudo service dnsmasq start

Hopefully you should have no errors and be able to see your new WiFi hotspot.
